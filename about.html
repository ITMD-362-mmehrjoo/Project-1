              COVID-19 vaccine is being distributed to Wisconsin residents in a phased approach. Vaccine supply is limited and vaccinations are targeted to specific groups of people with a higher risk for COVID-19 infection. We ask that if you are able to work from home or do not have to interact with the public, please let your fellow Wisconsinites that have a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 get vaccinated first.
              While some groups became eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine on March 1, vaccine providers may prioritize previously eligible groups before newer groups. Based on the amount of vaccine doses available, it may take months for all newly eligible groups to get vaccinated.
              Every community is different. Some places may be able to start vaccinating your group earlier than others. But everyone will eventually have the opportunity to get vaccinated.
